Incidence of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in São Paulo Metropolitan Region after the 2020 Brazil election.

Theme: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - Includes COVID-19 

Source: https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/bd-srag-2020 

Extraction data: 2020/12/06

Period: date of the 1st symptom, from 10 to 48 epidemiological weeks - 2020/01/03 to 2020/11/08.

Method: The incidence was calculated by Number of SARS cases from 10 to 46 epidemiological weeks (2020/03/01 to 2020/11/14) before 2020 election and new cases in Number of cases from 47 to 48 epidemiological weeks (2020/11/15 to 2020/11/28) after 2020 election.
The incidence formula is: number of new cases / total of cases in the period

Objective: In Brazil a hypothesis arose about the increase of SARS cases after the 2020 Brazil election. I'd like to show you how this increase was in the largest population area of the São Paulo state, the Metropolitan Region, that's involves São Paulo city and some others around it. 
To accomplish the final project of the course Maps and the Geospatial Revolution from Coursera you need to tell a history from a map, I created this map using Python to finish this course. I had to learn how build maps from this sotfware to finally do a choropleth map showing the incidence of SARS after the 2020 Brazil election.

I hope you like that!
Tks!.
